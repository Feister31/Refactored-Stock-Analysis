# Refactored-Stock-Analysis
### Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is to understand the changes of stocks between 2017 and 2018. Which stock had the biggest change and which had the smallest. When asking about the changes of volume in a particular stock over the span of two years. We first have to understand the changes that simmilar stocks have changed during that time.
### First Glance At Result
After conducting a extensive analysis on the listed stocks. There seems to be a trend of a bull year for 2017 and a bear market for the following year. As shown here:

The only stock to have the same postive yield over the span of these two years is the stock ticker name ENPH. One of big eye openers is that ENPH had one of the most daily total volume of all twleve of the listed stocks. Meaning that the company is on the rise and is entering the beginning stages of its product cycle. Surviving what surely was a recession in the following in. using VBA I was able to quickly determine the parameter of this project and quickly develop a script to run through all the raw data that was collected.
### Summary
During this project I was able to really test out the limits of VBA. Techques such as refactoring can greatly boost the productivity of any given tasks. Altought it can shorten the run time for a particular script, it does come with its own disadvantages as well.The advatanges of using the VBA script while refractor gives a cleaner look and feel to the code itself. While presenting comments can clarify the object of each block of code. It can serve as as well guided instruciton for others who might be using such script in a different context. Some of the techniqucal advantages includes its flexibility and offers a fresh, easy way to interpret and understand the code. The chances for mistakes and completion of a running code can offer many problems as it pretains to its dissadvantages. This can be an issue when a large code is required for a big data set.
